Great work Robert!

I really think that the application is coming together really well.

A few points that I wanted to comment on:

1 - I've left a few comments throughout the code about force casting, and force unwrapping, try to adapt these areas to avoid unintended crashes.

2 - Good work on the organization of the code and on using extensions to handle some generic changes and functions.

Again, great work, looking forward to seeing the finished application.
